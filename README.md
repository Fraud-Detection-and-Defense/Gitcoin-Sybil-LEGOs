HOW TO USE LEGOs

Each individual lego is a single signal of some sort of behavior we believe is associated with how a sybil attacker would behave.  To use a lego, this means you are interested in detecting duplicated accounts owned by a single individual and because for this goal, the sybil Lego can be deployed to identify accounts that exhibit that specific behavior.  If they fall in that category, then its safe to be suspicious of their legitimacy.  To further assert their legitimacy, use another lego, slowly but surely stacking evidence against the account until its certain the account was sybil.
